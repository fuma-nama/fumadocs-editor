## @fumadocs-editor/studio@0.1.1

### Studio starts under every install layout

`pnpx @fumadocs-editor/studio` died on startup with pnpm 11: its global
virtual store links only declared dependencies, and `@tiptap/y-tiptap` imports
`prosemirror-transform` without declaring it. npm, bun and hoisted pnpm
installs hid the bug.

- **`@fumadocs-editor/core`**: the Yjs binding (`@tiptap/y-tiptap` and the
  collaboration extensions) is bundled once, with its ProseMirror imports
  routed to `@tiptap/pm`. New: `createCollabSession(...).extensions(caret?)`
  returns the editor extensions for a session.
- **`@fumadocs-editor/ui`**: takes the collaboration extensions from the
  session; `yjs` and the `@tiptap` collaboration packages are no longer
  dependencies.
- **`@fumadocs-editor/studio`**: the dev server serves the assets of every
  package it loads a module from (fonts referenced by stylesheets) instead of
  guessing an install root, so packages spread across pnpm's global store or
  an npx cache resolve.

### Studio

`npx @fumadocs-editor/studio` opens a directory of `.mdx` files in the
editor without a host app: a sidebar ordered by `meta.json` and frontmatter
titles, autosave with live merge, `?collab`, and a `fumadocs-studio.config.ts`
for components, syntax, theme, auth, extra stylesheets and Vite plugins.
